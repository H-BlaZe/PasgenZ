# PassgenZ

This Python code is for a straightforward password generator application with a user-friendly graphical interface built using the Tkinter library. Its purpose is to allow users to create customized passwords based on their preferences. Users can choose to include uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters in their passwords. The code comprises three main functions:

1. `passDisplay(pwd)`: This function opens a new window to display the generated password. It provides options for copying the password to the clipboard, generating a new password, and returning to the main menu.

2. `brain(statBoth, statNum, statSpcl)`: This function handles the password generation process. It takes into account the user's selections for character sets (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters) and creates a password of the specified length.

3. `menu()`: This function sets up the main graphical interface. Users can check or uncheck boxes to include specific character sets, and they can choose the desired password length from a dropdown menu. By clicking the "Generate" button, users initiate the password generation process.

In summary, this code provides a simple and user-friendly tool for generating passwords, allowing users to customize the complexity and length of the passwords to suit their needs. It's an example of a basic GUI application created with Tkinter for password generation.
